      <p>Link is the name shared by the main protagonists of The Legend of Zelda series. There are many incarnations of Link, each possessing the Spirit of the Hero, with some of them being blood related as well. They are chosen by the Goddesses to protect the land from evil whenever deemed necessary. In the majority of Zelda games, their adventures take place within Hyrule, traveling through the land, collecting important items, and defeating a wide variety of enemies while trying to save both Princess Zelda and her kingdom from the clutches of Ganon, Vaati, or other villains.</p>

      <p>In Breath of the Wild, Link awakes from a deep sleep in the Shrine of Resurrection and is guided by a mysterious voice to take the Sheikah Slate and embark to the outside world, told that he must <q>shine upon Hyrule once again.</q> He then exits the Shrine and is free to explore Hyrule. Outside the Shrine, he finds an Old Man who later informs him that the Calamity Ganon was a source of many evils 100 years ago, until it was sealed in Hyrule Castle, which has been able to contain it for the past century. The Old Man also mentions that the Calamity Ganon is close to breaking free, giving Link a task in saving Hyrule.</p>

      <p>Link is afflicted by amnesia, as he is unable to remember anyone from prior to his rest in the Shrine of Resurrection.   Though as he regains memories he learns he used to be a knight in the service of Princess Zelda.</p>
